# Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets #
  ##### This repository holds an attempt to apply Linear model to predict whether a tweets is  disaster or not using data from "Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets" Kaggle challenge (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/data).
 ### Overview
    
  ##### The task, as defined by the Kaggle challenge is to use Natural Language processing to predict whether a given tweet is about a real disaster or not.  #####
   ##### The approach in this repository  is using text tweets as an input and train Linear model to predict whether it is a real disaster or not.The model had  average accuracy score of 0.6024.  #####
### Summary of WorkDone
   ##### Data:
   ##### Type: CSV file (train csv file and test csv file)
   ##### Input: , CSV file: image filename -> diagnosis
   ##### Input: CSV file of features, output: signal/background flag in 1st column.
   ##### Size: How much data? 10,876
